Basic examples for students

## Node

If in a node example - open a terminal to that folder location and type `npm start`

- this is the same for the heroku or AR examples; both are initiated with start scripts
- `node app.js` or `node index.js` but when set up properly with test, start, or other scripts in `package.json` we default to standard `npm start`

## Python

If in a python example - open a terminal to that folder location and type `python3 server.py` or `python server.py`

- If in the heroku python example type `python app.py` (or `python3 app.py`)
- Flask/gunicorn app environment self-starts a server, and so we do not need to specifically call one
